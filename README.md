# Construction-Spending-Time-Series-Analysis

Forecasting these residential construction costs is important in particular for potential homeowners and investors because it provides information for budgeting for projects. We hope to hedge against risk of losing resources and capital by forecasting costs for future months using sound estimates of future costs using a model that we feel best represents our data.
